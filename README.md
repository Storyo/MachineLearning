# Machine Learning - Style transfer

# torch2coreml
This folder contains the modified code from prisma torch2coreml. 
This version works for pytorch instead of torch and supports instance normalization while the prisma version, currently does not.
Original prisma version link: https://github.com/prisma-ai/torch2coreml

Example command to convert a pytorch model to a coreml model with 1024 resolution:
python pytorch2coreml/convert-fast-neural-style.py -input pytorchModels/takes.model -output pytorchModels/takes.mlmodel -size 1024

You can use these models in the IOS_TestProject.

# pytorchModels
Contains the current pytorch trained models and coreml models used in storyo for themes book and takes.

Note: To train more trained models use the implementation as shown in the following link: 
https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style

# compiled
Contains the compiled coreml models to use directly in storyo or any other xamarin IOS project that doesn't want to compile the models in execute time.

Example command to compile models:
"path to your applications folder"  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/coremlc compile pytorchModels/book.mlmodel compiled/
