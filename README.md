There are the following three folders:
1- fast-neural-style, contains the default pytorch implementation to train new style transfer models, 
its the same implementation as shown in the following link: 
https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style

2- torch2coreml, contains the modified code from prisma torch2coreml to convert pytorch instead of torch models to coreml. 
This version supports instance normalization while the prisma version does not.
Original prisma version link: https://github.com/prisma-ai/torch2coreml


3- Pretrained models, contains the current pytorch trained models and coreml models used in storyo for themes book and takes.
